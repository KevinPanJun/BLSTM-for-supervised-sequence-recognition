    <h1>Hidden Layer size vs Time for training network</h1>
    <p>The time complexity of training one pair of input and output sequences is of the order of the number of Weights, since we have to evaluate the weighted sum in forward pass and update all weights after backward pass</p>
    <p>Since total number of weights is W = 4IH + 4H<sup>2</sup> + 3H + HK we expect a quadratic dependancy between Number of Hidden Cells and Time </p>
    <p>For this experiment we use a data set of consisting of 20 sequences</p>

    <p>As the image shows, the relationship quadratic</p>
    <p>In the range of 10 to 3000, the size varies from 0.2 to 70 seconds</p>
    <p>For this experiment we use a network with 15 Input Features  and 173 Output classes</p>
