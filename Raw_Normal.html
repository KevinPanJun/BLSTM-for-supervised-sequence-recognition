    <h1>Performance of network using Raw Features vs Profile Features</h1>
    <p>On using raw features, which were extracted coloumn wise directly from the binarized image, the network error diminishes much quickly but running time of each epoch is more.</p>

    <p>On using profile features, the network error diminishes slowly and running time of each epoch is less than when we use raw features.</p>

    <p>Using Raw features, After 30 epochs Label error rate as less as 4% and word errer rate of 17% were achieved on training data.</p>

    <p>After 60 epochs Label error rate as less as 1.5% and word errer rate of 7% were achieved on training data and Label error rate of 6% and Word error rate of 23% were achieved on testing data.</p>
