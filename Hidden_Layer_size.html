    <title>Hidden Layer size vs Space occupied by network</title>

    <h1>Hidden Layer size vs Space occupied by network</h1>
    <p>The space required by the network is the same as the space required to store the weight of each edge</p>
    <p>Since total number of weights is W = 4IH + 4H<sup>2</sup> + 3H + HK we expect a quadratic dependancy between Number of Hidden Cells and Space</p>
    <img src="Size_Time/No of hidden cells vs Size.png" />
    <p>For this experiment we use 15 input features and an output layer of 173 classes</p>
    <p>As the image shows, the relationship is quadratic</p>
    <p>In the range of 10 to 3000, the size varies from 3Mb to 5.7 Gb. We use 150 hidden cells, which has a size of 50 Mb and after 30 epochs of training becomes 80 Mb</p>
