    <h1>Input Feature size vs Space occupied by network</h1>
    <p>The space required by the network is the same as the space required to store the weight of each edge</p>
    <p>Since total number of weights is W = 4IH + 4H<sup>2</sup> + 3H + HK we expect a linear dependancy between Number of input features and Space</p>
    <img src="Size_Time/No of input features vs Size.png" />
    <p>As the image shows, the relationship is linear with a small positive slope</p>
    <p>In the range of 10 to 3000, the size varies from 29 to 270 Mb</p>
    <p>For this experiment we use a network with 100 Hidden cells and 50 Output blocks</p>
